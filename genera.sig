S,EnhancedGenus,"Compute genus from permutation triple f:X -> Y. 2gX-2 = deg(f)*(2gY-2) + sum_xinX (ex -1). ex is the ramification degree of x. An element of S_n acts on sheets of the cover. x is ramified if x is sent to another point under the action of an isotropy subgroup, i.e. the cycle type corresponding to x has length >1. The length is the ramification degree",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,82,,148,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
